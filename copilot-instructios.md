take the Untitled58.ipynb as reference for the neural network architecture used. what i want you to do is to implement the same architecture from absolute scratch. you may use pytorchs data structure and its cuda integration.

By scratch, i mean you will have to implement the neural networks from ground up without using any prebuilt components(except pytorchs datastructure, you can use that instead of numpy for its cuda integration). Even the attention mechanism should be built from scratch. The same goes for the backpropagation and the optimizer.

You can use the preprocessed data as it is given in the reference notebook

Split the project into multiple files for easier readability
