# Neural Machine Translation Project - Key Points

## 🎯 **What We Built**

A **Neural Machine Translation system (English → French)** implemented **completely from scratch** using only PyTorch tensors — no high-level `nn.Module` or pre-built layers.

## 🏆 **Core Achievement**

Built a production-ready seq2seq model by implementing every component manually:
- ✅ Custom Linear layers with Xavier initialization
- ✅ Custom Embedding layers
- ✅ Complete LSTM cells and layers from scratch
- ✅ Bahdanau attention mechanism

## 🎓 **Key Components Explained**

### **Encoder**
- Takes English sentence as input
- Embeds words into continuous vectors
- Processes with bidirectional LSTM
- Outputs hidden states for each word

### **Attention Mechanism**
- Decoder looks at ALL encoder hidden states
- Computes importance scores for each input word
- Creates context vector (weighted sum of encoder states)
- Helps model "focus" on relevant parts

### **Decoder**
- Generates French translation word-by-word
- Uses previous word + context vector + hidden state
- Attention helps it know where to look in input
- Outputs probability distribution over French vocabulary

## 📝 **Technical Depth**

### Example: LSTM Cell Implementation
We manually implemented all LSTM gates:
```
Input Gate:  i_t = σ(W_ii*x_t + W_hi*h_(t-1) + b_i)
Forget Gate: f_t = σ(W_if*x_t + W_hf*h_(t-1) + b_f)
Cell Gate:   g_t = tanh(W_ig*x_t + W_hg*h_(t-1) + b_g)
Output Gate: o_t = σ(W_io*x_t + W_ho*h_(t-1) + b_o)

Cell State:  c_t = f_t ⊙ c_(t-1) + i_t ⊙ g_t
Hidden:      h_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(c_t)
```

This shows **complete understanding** of the mathematics, not just API usage.
